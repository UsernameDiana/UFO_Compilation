# UFO Questionaire for group 3
This questionaire has the goal of collecting feedback for improving the documentation here 
https://github.com/ProjectHackernewsGroup04/Ops/blob/master/readme.md and here https://github.com/ProjectHackernewsGroup04/Documentation/blob/master/README.md

## Questionaire
The questionaire is on Google Forms. It can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZEXAcf08bYwd76H5is8itx5DvHADGFYIRSEppWxAZwA)

## Responses
All of the responses can be seen in [this document](https://github.com/ProjectHackernewsGroup04/Ops/blob/master/answer-summary.pdf)

There are 3 people who responded on the questionaire.
Almost all of the answers to the questions were positive and did not provide any indication of possible improvement of the documentation.

For the question `Could You run the docker operations on all containers?` everyone answered `No user given` which indicates that our communication
on how to log on to the server possibly wasn't clear enough. We told them we could hand over a private key for them to use if they contacted us through Keybase.
This might have been misunderstood or they completely missed the message.

On the question `If You have some comments on how to improve our Ops documentation, please let us know below :)` there was one answer:
`Better grammar.` which is pretty useless unless you point out in what document or section you've found bad grammar.

### Changes made based on response
- We've read through the documentation again and corrrected a few spelling mistakes
- We've contacted the group again to make sure they understand the handover of provate keys

## Time estimates
The time estimate for producing the original documentation is approximately 11 hours.

The time we used to solve this entire exercise is approximately 4 hours. That includes: formulating the questions, creating Google Forms questionaire, analysis of responses,
writing this document, correcting spelling mistakes and contacting group 3 again to make sure they understood the handover process.
