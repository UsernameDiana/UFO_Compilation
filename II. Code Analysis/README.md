# II. Code Analysis & Performance

> ### Exercise 1
> Run PMD on your chosen project.
> As there are 100s of different metrics (in the different subcategories), you have to argue for which 10 you pick. In particular what situation would make those you pick particular relevant. 


> - PMD report


> - A small report (I prefer a markdown in the same github) stating why you picked the 10 checks you did, and why those are important

> _Notice: some checks will not find any issues with your code. You need to find some checks which actually finds issues in the code._


> ### Exercise 2
> You can again pick something from a project you have done yourself.


> - Profile result:



> - Micro-benchmark:
