   <h2>The Project</h2>
<p>The task for the semester project in the database course is to build a small 
    application that allows to figure out which cities are mentioned in which 
    English books from Project Gutenberg, given a city which books mentioned it, 
    and given a location, which books mention citis in vicinity.</p>
</br>
<b>The application has these User Stories:</b>
<ol>        
<li>
    Given a city name your application returns all book titles with corresponding authors that mention this city.
</li>
<li>
 Given a book title, your application plots all cities mentioned in this book onto a map.
</li> 
<li>
Given an author name, your application lists all books written by that author and plots all cities mentioned in any of the books onto a map.
</li>
<li>
Given a geolocation, your application lists all books mentioning a city in vicinity of the given geolocation. 
</li>
</ol>
