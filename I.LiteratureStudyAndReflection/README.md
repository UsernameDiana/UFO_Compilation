# I. Literature Study & Reflection
### Question to be investigated:
> - _Investigate the quality of the queries in the .Net entoty framework. In particular, it is said the technology prevents client side joins._
> - _Find some examples of Linq queries and their translation into SQL which best show how client-side joins are avoided._
> - _What is a Linq query?_
> - _Keep track of how you solve the exercise._


### Exercise:
> _A list of all Google queries you made to solve it, and timestamps (just copy it from the browser history)_

> _A list of the 3 most biggest stumbling blocks you came across and your reflection on why they were problematic (did you misunderstand something, was some of the info you found wrong, did you miss a detail, …)_

1. **OS Support** 
    * Linqpad is focused on Microsoft .NET development so it means it doesn't support other OS than Windows.
2. **Limited guideline and help about linq**
    * The information and help about linq is very limited, you can clearly observe it in stackoverflow where there are 460.000 questions about SQL while there are only 70.000 questions about Linq.
3.  **Understanding linq syntax**
    * This is a learing process, everyone have to go though to understand the linq syntax.       

> _A brief “every 30 min” diary as explained in the slides (this is more frequent than one would normally do, and is just meant as part of the exercise)_

Timestamp | Problem | Notes | Idea | Expect to be Done

asda | asdasd | asdasd | asda sd | asdasd







### Conclusion:
> _A brief summary of which aspect of the exercise was taking you the longest time to solve, which part of the exercise was side tracking you the most (which dead-ends did you persue), and what was the most helpful information you came across (it could be someone else helping you). How can you avoid those problems in the future, and how can the helpful ressources help you in the future?_
