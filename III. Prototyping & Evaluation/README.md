> ## Exercise 1 

There are digital ocean droplets running in different parts of the world. The are all set up to respond to ping. Their addresses are the following:

- http://139.59.132.185:8080
- http://192.81.216.124:8080
- http://128.199.180.131:8080

### 1. Plan

*Formulate a hypothesis/problem statement about behavior of response times of these three servers.* 

The servers is located in different places in the world and we assumes that the distance from the request-source to the location of the server will determine the response latency very visible.

Thence our hypothesis is : 

> "The distance to the location of the server will determine the response latency in MiliSeconds(MS), so we assumes that the further distance is, the latency will increase"



### 2. Setup

*Plan an experiment, which measures response times of these three servers.*

We have to gain 3 given facts about the servers:

	1. The location of the ip
	2. The distance between the server and our request-source
	3. The response time for the server

> 1. The locations

There are many places where we can get information about the location of the ip. As start we will be using a iplocation lookup provider (https://www.iplocation.net/).
